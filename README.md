The “Freedom Project” for SEP10 is all about ways we can learn web design and development with researching topics that interest us.The purpose of this blog is to help people learn more about possible jobs and interests they can have while still doing coding. 


For my project, I am making a website about Jobs in technology using Github, HTML, CSS, and media queries. This blog will walk through my process of independently studying web design and possible future job opportunities making the website.
