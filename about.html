<h3 class="me"> ABOUT ME<br>
My name is Amelia and I am the creator of Jobs In Technology! The purpose of this project was to not only inform people of possible job opportinitues, but also for me to learn website design technique. I learned how to format a site through CSS and HTML. These skills helped me achieve this site. I learned how to make working buttons, a navigation bar to easily help you navigate the website, and I learned how coloring on a site can make it better or worse.
