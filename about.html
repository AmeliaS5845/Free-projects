<p> <b>Welcome to Jobs In Technology. This is to bring awareness to jobs coders can do. These jobs can be creative, scientific, technical. They are all vital parts in companies and organizations. These jobs can broaden what was initally classfied as a job. I hope to inspire people to persue coding as a passion. <b></p>
